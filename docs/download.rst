HRM download
************

Installation script
===================

The script downloads, installs and sets up the HRM and its requested dependences while allowing for a certain degree of configurability. The detailed instructions can be found `here <./script_install.html>`_.

|ubuntu| |fedora| `Download the installation script <https://github.com/aarpon/hrm_installer/releases>`_.

Standard archive
================

The HRM archive is the standard installation approach: you have full control over the installation procedure, but you'll have to do all the work yourself. Just unpack the code and install it following the `instructions <./manual_install.html>`_.

|note| This is the only way to install the HRM on platforms not supported by the installation script or to tweak the set up beyond the set of options provided by it.

|linux| `Download the archive <https://sourceforge.net/projects/hrm/files/latest/download>`_.
