Using a measured PSF
==========
This option will only appear if 'measured PSF' was selected as PSF Type in a previous step.

Distilled PSFs need to be created beforehand using Huygens Professional and placed
in the src folder on the HRM drive.

.. note:: It is important to use only one image per channel, 
			multichannel PSFs are not supported.
          

When presented with the **Distilled PSF file selection**-window,

|DistilledPsfFileSelection1|
			
			
browse for the distilled PSF appropriate for the channel(s) your image contains.

|DistilledPsfFileSelectionBrowse|
			
			

Select your file of choice and click close. Repeat for all channels.

|DistilledPsfFileSelection2|
			
			

Afterwards, press save and return to the image parameter selection page.

.. note:: Appropriate PSFs are highlighted in black.
