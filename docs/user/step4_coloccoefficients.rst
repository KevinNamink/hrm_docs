Colocalization coefficients
===========================

HRM can report all the colocalization coefficients that are most broadly used in fluorescence microscopy.

Select here which colocalization coefficients should be used to quantify the amount of overlap between channels.

A colocalization report with all these findings will be ready when the job is finished.

For further information on specific colocalization coefficients please read `this article from the SVI wiki <http://www.svi.nl/ColocalizationCoefficients>`_.
