Choose among the supported microscope types: **widefield**, **confocal**,
**spinning disk**, **multiphoton**, **STED** and **STED 3D**.
Depending on your Huygens license some of these options might not show.

.. note:: Notice that HRM requires the microscope type from the user. HRM
          will **NOT** load the microscope type from the selected images
          automatically. In fact, that would not be possible in most cases.
