After submitting a job HRM returns to the home panel. The Queue Status button
shows how many queued jobs you own, as follows:

|QueueStatusScreenshot|

Click on the button to get a detailed view of the job queue.

HRM manages the deconvolution of multiple jobs owned by different users
through a smart queue. The job being processed is marked in green.

To delete any of your jobs, select them in the queue view and click
|TrashBin22x22| .

.. note:: Depending on the HRM configuration settings, a notification email
          will be sent to the job owner when the job is finished. 

If the job's result seems wrong, try to verify if there is a mistake in the
settings. Contact the HRM administrator otherwise.
