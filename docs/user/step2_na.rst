Numerical aperture
==================

The Numerical Aperture (NA) describes the amount of light coming from the focus
that the objective can collect.

The NA depends on the half angle of the maximum cone of light that can enter
or exit the lens. It is directly linked to the resolution of the objective.

Tipically, you can find the NA **engraved** on the objective next to the
magnification.

.. note:: Notice that depending on the file format that you are using the
          parameter may be skipped or must be provided.
