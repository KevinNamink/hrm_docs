The Raw Images Folder
*********************

To upload images for deconvolution, go to the *Raw Images* section.
Press the *upload* button as shown in `See Raw images section. Files can
be uploaded and deleted
here. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_95452>`__. Next, use
the *browse* button at the bottom of the page to select a file for
upload. Once a file has been added, it is possible to add more files
using the *add more files* button in red. Additionally it is possible to
add several files at once, by compressing them to an archive and
uploading the archive. Huygens will automatically depackage the archive
and add the embedded files. Note that this will also decrease your
upload time, since the data is compressed.


After all the desired files have been selected, upload them using the
*upload* icon again. When finished all the files will be added to your
*Raw Images* directory. This is a personal directory with all the userâ€™s
unprocessed images.
