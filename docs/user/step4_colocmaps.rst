Colocalization map
==================

While a colocalization coefficient quantifies the level of overlap between two
whole channels, a colocalization map displays the value of a specific
colocalization coefficient for each voxel of the two channels.

Therefore, a colocalization map is a 3D image of the level of overlap between
the two channels, according to a specific coefficient. 

It is possible to choose between the 4 most widely used colocalization
maps. The maps will be displayed in the colocalization report after
the job is finished.

.. note:: The colocalization maps help us to assess the colocalization
          regions visually.

As an example the below figure shows the deconvolution result of channels 0
and 3 next to the colocalization map (Pearson coefficient) of the same channels.
