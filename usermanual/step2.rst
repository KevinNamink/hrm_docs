The Image Parameters (2/5)
==========================

In *Start a job - Image Parameters* the image parameters can be
specified and saved. The image parameters are grouped in sets, which
describe the microscope and the conditions used to acquire the images. A
parameter set can be reused in future deconvolution jobs. This will make
sense as long as the involved images have been acquired under the
conditions specified in the parameter set.

The *Start a job - Image Parameters* page shows 3 main areas (see `See
Image parameters, main
page. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_15842>`__):

-  *Template Image Parameters (1)* : parameter sets created by the HRM
   administrator. These can be used as references. They can be copied
   and changed by the HRM users.
-  *Your Image Parameters (2)* : The user’s parameter sets. These may be
   based on administrator templates or created by the user with
   customized values.

-  *New/Clone Parameter Set Name (3)* : Entry field for the name of a
   new parameter set. Type a name for the new set and click on the *add*
   button. A new set of parameters will be created. It is advised to
   write clear, easy-to-understand names for the parameter sets.

In order to handle (create, delete, edit etc.) sets, there are icons at
the bottom of the page. Each with a tooltip, stating it’s function.

A set of parameters consists of a number of relevant microscopic
parameters. These provide Huygens Core with information about the images
that will be deconvolved. The microscopic parameters of a particular set
can be seen in the preview on the right or by editing it.

When a set is edited its parameters are displayed with links to the
SVI-wiki where explanations are provided. These links are represented by
question mark icons throughout HRM.
