Getting started
***************

Here is a quick guide to get you started with the HRM/HuCore deconvolution. In
order to optimize results, please refer to section :ref:`advanced_deconvolution`.

Create an account in HRM
========================

-  If your imaging facility already offers deconvolution via HRM, proceed to
   the facility's HRM loging page.
   
-  If HRM is not available at your imaging facility you can still familiarize with
   HRM by using the `HRM demo server <http://hrm.svi.nl>`_ offered by
   SVI.

Follow the registration link on the HRM login page and complete the short
form. Notice that names are case sensitive. Upon registration the new HRM
account needs to be validated by the administrator.

|RegistrationLink| |RegistrationForm|


Upload a raw image
==================

Upon successful logging the HRM `Home panel` will be displayed:

|HomePanel|

To upload images click on the `Raw images` icon |RawImages22x22|. The
following, intuitive upload tool allows for multiple uploads from your local
device:

|UploadFiles|


Deconvolve
==========

To submit a deconvolution job proceed to `Start a job` |StartJob22x22| from
the home panel. The process of submitting the job is split into the following
5 steps:


* |SelectImages48x48| **Step 1/5 - Select images**: click on the "Image File
  Format" drop
  down  widget to select the desired file type for the images that you wish to
  deconvolve. All files of that format in your `"Raw Images"` folder will be
  listed. Use the |DownArrow22x22| |UpArrow22x22| icons to discard/include
  images from/into the selection. When selecting a file, a preview can be
  requested by using the link |GeneratePreviewLink| on the right panel. The
  image preview also provides information about the dimensions, sampling and
  number of channels.


* |ImageParameters48x48| **Step 2/5 - Image parameters**: An image parameter
  template
  matching the imaging conditions of the microscope can be created at this
  stage. Alternatively, an existing template can be selected from a
  previous run. Also, other HRM users (including the administrator) may have
  shared templates with you. Notice that choosing the correct parameters
  is **crucial** for obtaining optimal deconvolution results.

  **Use existing parameter template (easy)**: When selecting an existing
  parameter template the parameter contents are displayed on the right panel.
  Make sure that the  microscope type and the number of channels of the
  selected template match those of the images to deconvolve.

  **Create a new parameter template (elaborated)**: Type a name for the new
  parameter template in the `New/clone image template name` field, then click
  the create button |CreateTemplate22x22|. The template editor opens, select
  the correct
  number of channels and PSF type. Move on to the optical parameters and
  select the correct microscope type. For a detailed explanation on the
  remaining parameters please refer to section :ref:`advanced_deconvolution`.

* |RestorationParameters48x48| **Step 3/5 - Restoration parameters**:
  As in the previous step it's possible to choose between an existing template
  or creating a new one.
  
  **Use existing parameter template (easy)**: Select a parameter template
  and verify its contents on the preview shown on the right panel.
  Particularly, pay attention to the value
  of the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) (see :ref:`signal_to_noise_ratio` for
  further help).
  
  **Create a new parameter template (elaborated)**:
  Follow the instructions of the previoius step to create a new template.
  Once in the template editor select a deconvolution algorithm (CMLE is 
  a good choice) and an SNR. Follow the instructions of the embedded SNR
  estimator for a hint on the SNR of your images. Set the background mode to
  automatic, the number of iterations to 40 and the quality change to 0.01.
  For more detailed fine-tuning follow the instructions at
  :ref:`advanced_deconvolution`.

* |AnalysisParameters48x48| **Step 4/5 - Analysis parameters**: This step is
  active only when 2 or more channels have been specified in the previous
  steps. When active, the Analysis step allows the user to execute
  Colocalization analysis on the deconvolved images.

  **Use existing parameter template (easy)**: Select the analysis parameter
  template of your choice and verify that the values displayed on the preview
  on the right panel match your analysis needs.

  **Create a new parameter template (elaborated)**: Create a new template by
  following the instructions given in Step 2. Select whether colocalization
  should be enabled. For a colocalization run select the channels that
  should be inspected and the colocalization coefficients to be reported.
  Set  the threshold to "Automatic estimation" and the Colocalization map
  to "Pearson". In order to further fine-tune the Colocalization parameters
  please refer to :ref:`advanced_deconvolution`.


* |LaunchJob48x48| **Step 5/5 - Launch job**: Select the output file format
  for the restored images. ICS and HDF5 are the recommended formats because
  they provide good dynamic range and the necessary metadata infrastructure to
  save all the image parameters. Plus, they allow for good compression levels
  that minimize the amount of disk space needed for storage. Next, review the
  parameter summaries as well as the image selection. If all the settings are
  correct then proceed to submit the job to the server by clicking
  |SubmitJob30x22|.


Queue
=====

After submitting the job HRM returns to the Home panel from where you can
access the queue by clicking |JobQueue22x22|. A typical processing queue
looks like the following:

|JobQueueScreenshot|

where you view how much work from you and other HRM users has been submitted
to the processing server. This queue is handled in an intelligent way,
allowing jobs from different users to be processed at different times.


Results
=======

When a deconvolution and analysis job is finished you will get an email
notifying you that the results are available. In order to view the deconvolved
images go to the HRM home panel and click on the `Results` icon
|Results22x22|. The contents of the `Results` folder will be listed. Select
the image that you would like to visualize and a preview will be displayed
on the right panel, like this:

|ResultImages|

For a detailed view click on the link shown on the right panel. A results page
will open showing `MIP <http://www.svi.nl/MIP>`_,
`SFP <http://www.svi.nl/SFP>`_ and slicer comparisons of the raw image versus the
deconvolved image. Summary tables will show information about possible scaling
factors, colocalization results as well as deconvolution and image parameters.
Also, movies along the Z direction and/or through time will be available for
download.

Tips & Tricks
=============


* When a deconvolution run gives excellent results download the processed
  data from the detailed view by clicking on |DownloadResults22x22| .
* If you are satisfied with any of the templates that you have created do
  share them with your colleagues by clicking on |ShareTemplate22x22| in steps
  2, 3 or 4.
* To optimize your deconvolution results it is necessary to understand the
  different properties of your image and some of the mechanisms behind
  deconvolution. If youâ€™ve followed this guide, many properties have been
  assigned default values. We would like to encourage the users to read
  into and explore different settings, which will help you improve your
  deconvolution results. Some more in-depth knowledge is given in section
  section :ref:`advanced_deconvolution`.
