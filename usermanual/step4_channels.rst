Channels
========

In order to be able to investigate any combination of two channels present in your images, select here which channels must be studied.

|ColocChannelsScreenshot|

The selection shown in the figure above will trigger colocalization analysis on channels:

* 0 and 1,
* 0 and 2,
* 1 and 2.

And so forth for images with up to 5 channels (HRM's limit). Thus, this allows for large scale colocalization in batch mode.
