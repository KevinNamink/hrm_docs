Tips & Tricks
*************

* **File uploads**: When using the browser uploader it is possible to upload
  compressed files containing more images. HRM will uncompress the file and
  set the contents in your raw folder.

* **Getting previews**: Select an image and click on `Generate preview` to
  visualize the image contents plus the dimensions and sampling sizes. The
  colours used in the preview depict the wavelengths provided by the image
  metadata.

* **Voxel sizes**: Whenever possible HRM shows highlighted in yellow the
  ideal voxel sizes according to the Nyquist criterion.

* **SNR estimation**: Notice that it's possible to zoom in the thumbnails
  displayed by the SNR estimator by moving the mouse pointer over the
  thumbnails. This can be useful to confirm the correctness of the SNR

* **SNR estimation**: The SNR can highly influence the deconvolution result.
  On the one hand, if the deconvolution result looks too smooth and details
  are missing, a higher SNR value can be used. On the other hand, if the
  result looks too grainy one can try to use a lower SNR value.
