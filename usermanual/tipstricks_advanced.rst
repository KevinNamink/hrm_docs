-  When doing deconvolution jobs for a batch, up to as many channels as
   configured for will be deconvolved.

*For example* : a user wants to deconvolve three images with one, three
and four channels respectively. He may specify three channels in the
*Image Parameter* settings. Then, the first and second image will be
fully deconvolved, while for the last image, only the first three
channels are deconvolved. Additionally, for the first image, only the
parameters for the first channel are used.


  If all the optical parameters (numerical aperture, refractive indexes, etc)
  were entered in the previous steps, HRM will so that
  it can be used as a reference.
