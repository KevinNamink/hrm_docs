Select images (1/5)
===================

In the *Select Images* the user can add images to the deconvolution
list, only one file type (per extension) can be deconvolved per batch,
as illustrated in `See Select images page. Only files of the selected
format are displayed, on the right is a preview of the selected image.

NIEHS. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_11971>`__. Select
the desired file format and use the up and down arrows to select the
images for batch deconvolution. Several images can be selected at once
to do batch processing. Keep in mind that these images must share the
same microscopic parameters in order to obtain good deconvolution
results. This is generally true if the images are recorded with the same
setup.

whenever possible. The user can click on *Click to generate preview* to
