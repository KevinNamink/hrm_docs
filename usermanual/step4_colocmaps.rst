Colocalization map
==================

While a colocalization coefficient quantifies the level of overlap between two whole channels, a colocalization map displays the value of a specific colocalization coefficient for each voxel of the two channels.

Therefore, a colocalization map is a 3D image of the level of overlap between the two channels, according to a specific coefficient. 

It is possible to choose between the 4 most broadly used colocalization
maps. The maps will be displayed along with the colocalization reports after
the job is finished.

.. note:: The colocalization maps helps us to assess the colocalization
          regions visually.

As an example the below figure shows the deconvolution result of channels 0 and 3
next to the colocalization map (Pearson coefficient) of the same channels.
