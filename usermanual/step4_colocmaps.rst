Colocalization map
==================

While a colocalization coefficient quantifies the level of overlap between two whole channels, a colocalization map displays the value of a specific colocalization coefficient for each voxel of the two channels.

Therefore, a colocalization map is a 3D image of the level of overlap between the two channels, according to a specific coefficient. 

It is possible to choose between the 4 most broadly used colocalization maps.

These maps will be displayed along with the colocalization reports after the job is finished.
