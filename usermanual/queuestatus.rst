****************
The Queue status
****************

HRM manages the deconvolution of multiple jobs owned by different users
through a queue. When clicking on the “\ *Queue status* ” button all the
waiting jobs are listed. The job currently processed is marked in green
(See `See The queue. Jobs marked in green are currently being
processed. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_10833>`__).

To monitor the owned jobs and optionally delete them, select the
corresponding lines from the queue and click on the “\ *trash bin* ”
button.

When enabled by the administrator, HRM will send a notification email
after the deconvolution job is finished. If an error occurs the user
will also get a notification. In that case please contact the system
administrator.

If something seems wrong, try to verify if there is a mistake in the
settings. Try to contact the system administrator otherwise.

Notice that because HRM can be installed on a combination of dedicated
servers the deconvolution process is usually performed with a good
computation speed.
