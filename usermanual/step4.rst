Analysis parameters (4/5)
=========================

After deconvolution the restored image can be analyzed. There are
several tools available for doing so in Huygens. Currently HRM already
supports the colocalization analyzer, and more tools will be added soon.

As in previous parameter steps, there are a number of template analysis
parameters, while it is still possible to edit or create new sets. When
selected, details of a set are shown in the right panel. The settings
window is shown in `See Set colocalization settings. The values shown in
the figure are generally suitable for default
