The user statistics can be reached from the HRM starting page (See `See
The main menu. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_87999>`__).
This turns out to be a straightforward and useful way for anyone to
quickly see how he or she is using HRM and what the image and
restoration trends are.

Clicking on *Your Statistics* brings the user to a page that summarizes
and shows statistical information about the deconvolution jobs. This
page collects and displays data about the percentages of output formats
used, the percentages of input formats, the type of Point Spread
Function, the image geometry, the microscope type, and the time used for
the userâ€™s deconvolution jobs.

All of this can be split according to the initial and final dates
selected by the user to compute the statistics (See `See Your statistics
in HRM. A straightforward way to check how HRM is being used and what
image and restoration trends there are in the deconvolution
jobs. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_27947>`__).
