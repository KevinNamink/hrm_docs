This section explains in detail how to create and launch
deconvolution jobs in HRM. It also describes how to inspect deconvolution
results and how to view user statistics.

For the sake of clarity, it is recommended to emulate the explanations here
in an actual HRM installation. For instructions on how to request an HRM
account please see :ref:`create_an_account`.

With an HRM account deconvolution and analysis jobs can be run remotely,
in batch mode, with just a few clicks.
