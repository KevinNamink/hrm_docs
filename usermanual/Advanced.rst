This chapter explains in more detail how to create and launch
deconvolution jobs in HRM. Instructions on how to inspect deconvolution
results and how to access statistics in HRM are also included here.

It is recommended to visit an HRM site so that the job launching process
can be reproduced. An HRM account at an imaging facility can be
requested by sending an application to the corresponding administrator.
This task can be performed from within HRM as highlighted in `See Login
and registration
page <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_70213>`__. Upon
clicking on the *register* link, the user is asked to fill out a short
form that will be forwarded to the administrator.

If the imaging facility of interest does not provide access to an HRM
installation it is still possible to get familiar with HRM by requesting
an account for the HRM demo server\ `7 <#50532361_pgfId-926247>`__\ at
SVI.

With an HRM account deconvolution jobs can be run remotely, in batch
mode, with just a few clicks.
