The Image Parameters (2/5)
==========================

In step 2 - |ImageParameters22x22| **Image Parameters** - the microscope
settings can be specified and saved. The image parameters are grouped in
templates. A parameter template can be reused in future deconvolution jobs.
This will be useful when there are more images recorded under the same
conditions. Moreover, the parameter templates can be shared among HRM users,
fostering collaboration and re-usage of good image settings.


Notice that the following selections are possible at this stage:

* **Admin image templates**: parameter sets created by the HRM administrator to
  be used as references. They can be copied and edited by the HRM users. In
  order to use them, they first need to be copied to **Your image templates**
  by using |DownArrow22x22|.
   
* **Your image templates**: the image templates the user can actually use
  directly. All templates in this area may be selected, edited, removed, etc.

* **New/clone image template**: entry field for the name of a new parameter
  template. First type a name for the new template and click on
  |CreateTemplate22x22|. A new template will be created. HRM will show the user
  the template parameters so that meaningful values can be given to them.


  .. note:: Notice the |CreateTemplate22x22| |EditTemplate22x22|
            |CloneTemplate22x22| |ShareTemplate22x22| |FavouriteTemplate22x22|
            |DeleteTemplate22x22| show a tooltip stating their function with
            templates.

A parameter template consists of a number of relevant microscopic
parameters. These provide Huygens Core with information about the images
that will be deconvolved. The microscopic parameters of a particular set
can be seen in the preview on the right or by editing it.

When a set is edited its parameters are displayed with links to the
SVI-wiki where explanations are provided. These links are represented by
question mark icons throughout HRM.
