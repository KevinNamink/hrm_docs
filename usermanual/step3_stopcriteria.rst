Stopping criteria
=================

The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm is an iterative
method. This means that the algorithm computes sequential solutions
which converge to a stable deconvolution result. Deconvolution will stop
when either of the following two conditions is met.

-  *Number of iterations* : sets the maximum number of iterations that
   Huygens will compute.
-  *Quality change* : how much the results of two consecutive iterations
   differ. If two subsequent results differ less than the Quality Change
   the convergence has been reached.

The Restoration Parameter set is now ready. Upon saving it HRM will show
the list of available restoration parameter sets. Choose one and click
on the big *right arrow* to continue to the next step (see `See
Restoration Parameter set: Deconvolution algorithm, SNR estimation,
background mode and stopping
criteria. <HRM/HRM%20Deconvolution%20Jobs.htm#50532397_53130>`__).


The image, restoration and analysis parameter sets can be reused to
launch other deconvolution jobs with the same microscopic and processing
properties.
