Threshold
=========

Before colocalization a threshold can be set, under which no
colocalization will be measured. Doing so will prevent measuring the
overlap between unwanted background noise. HRM includes an automatic
estimation option, which often works very good. Depending on the desired
result and the image, a threshold can be set for each channel. For
example, if there is cross-talk between channels, setting a threshold
can eliminate colocalization between cross-talk signal.
